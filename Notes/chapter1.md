# The Role of Algorithm in computoing:
## what are algorithms and why it's important for software industry:
* Algorithms describe the relation between input and output in a suitable and efficient way
* it's impotant because it help programers to find the suit way to solve specific problem especially if it's large and more complicated so Algorithms hepls us to do that
* also Algorithms help peogremers to minimize their code to make best of the memeory 
* some examples on the usage of Algorithms like:
>if you have a huge numbers so you want to sort it you can do it easly 
by using Algorithms : input : A1,A2,A3,.......
then the Alogrithm that you will find will sort it in the best way
ouput : A1',A2',A3',..........
