# The Role of Algorithm in computing:
## what are algorithms and why it's important for software industry:
* Algorithms describe the relation between input and output in a suitable and efficient way
* it's impotant because it helps programers to find the suit way to solve specific problem especially if it's large and more complicated so Algorithms help us to do that
* also Algorithms help programers to minimize their code to make best of the memeory 
* some examples on the usage of Algorithms like:
>if you have a huge numbers so you want to sort it you can do it easly 
by using Algorithms : input : A1,A2,A3,.......
then the Alogrithm that you will find will sort it in the best way
ouput : A1',A2',A3',..........
and also exist in many software applictions only happen with the aid of clever Algorithm
# Note:
## An Algorithm is concedered to be correct if , for every input instance it halts the correct output
# So how can we achieve Efficiency ?
## in fact,there are  different Algorithms are designed to solve the same problem but note that :
### you look for (Efficiency) so you will look for the best one to achieve fast performance a less space in memory so studying Algoritms well is  a must to achieve (Efficiency)
>for example you have insertion sort and merge sort these will be explained in chapter 2 in details anyway here we look for the best Algorithm for your problem so here insertion sort is better in small input size and merge sort is better in large input size so studying your problem well will also help you to find the best suit Algorithm
